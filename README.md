## Linear Regression

**Description:** Linear regression is a simple algorithm used for regression tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Logistic Regression

**Description:** Logistic regression is used for classification tasks. Despite its name, it's a linear model for binary classification that predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic curve.

## Decision Trees

**Description:** Decision trees are versatile algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. They partition the feature space into a tree-like structure based on feature values, allowing for simple decision-making.

## Random Forests

**Description:** Random forests are an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Description:** SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates data into different classes while maximizing the margin between classes.

## Naive Bayes

**Description:** Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features. Despite its simplicity, it's often effective for text classification and other tasks.

**How it works:** Given a set of features, Naive Bayes calculates the probability of each class label based on the feature values. It assumes that all features are conditionally independent, which means that the presence of one feature does not affect the presence of another.

**Application:** Naive Bayes is commonly used in text classification tasks such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. It's also used in medical diagnosis, email filtering, and recommendation systems.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Description:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and intuitive algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the K nearest data points to a given query point and making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of those neighbors.

**How it works:** To make predictions, KNN calculates the distance between the query point and all other data points in the dataset (usually using Euclidean distance). It then selects the K nearest neighbors and assigns the query point to the majority class (for classification) or averages their values (for regression).

**Application:** KNN is commonly used in recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition. It's also used in medical diagnosis, handwriting recognition, and image classification. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, and requires careful selection of the value of K and appropriate feature scaling.

## Neural Networks

**Description:** Neural networks are a class of models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers and are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data.

## K-means Clustering

**Description:** K-means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering tasks. It partitions data into K clusters by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest centroid and updating the centroids based on the mean of points assigned to each cluster.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Description:** PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving most of its variance. It identifies the orthogonal axes (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in the data.

## Q-Learning

**Description:** Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to learn optimal policies for sequential decision-making tasks. It learns by estimating the value of taking specific actions in particular states and updating these estimates based on rewards received.

## Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

**Description:** DQN is a deep learning-based reinforcement learning algorithm used to approximate Q-learning in environments with high-dimensional state spaces. It uses neural networks to estimate Q-values and learns directly from raw sensory inputs.
